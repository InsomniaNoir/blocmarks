### Social Bookmarking With Email Integration

It's easy enough to bookmark a URL in your browser, but eventually your bookmark library may get cluttered and it may require effort to manage bookmarks. Wouldn't you also like the ability to share bookmarks with friends? That is not something you can do easily from your native browser.

Blocmarks will solve these problems by organizing bookmarks by topic and making them public so that other users can find them and add bookmarks to their own Blocmarks profile.

* Sign up for a free account by providing a user name, password and e-mail
* Sign in and out of Blocmarks
* E-mail a URL to Blocmarks and have it saved in the Blocmarks database
* See an index of all topics and their bookmarks
* Create, read, update, and delete bookmarks
* Be the only one allowed to delete and update my bookmarks
* "like and unlike" bookmarks created by other users
* See a list of bookmarks on your personal profile that I've added or liked.

Project created as part of the Ruby on Rails Dev track on (Bloc.io)[http://www.bloc.io]
